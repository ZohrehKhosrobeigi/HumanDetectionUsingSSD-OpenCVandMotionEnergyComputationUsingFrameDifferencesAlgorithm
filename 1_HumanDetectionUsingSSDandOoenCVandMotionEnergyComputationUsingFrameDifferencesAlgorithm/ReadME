#Explanation of detection loop on HumanDetectionSSD class
The loop in the code, specifically the for i in range(detections.shape[2]): loop, iterates over the detected objects in a frame processed by the SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) model. Let's break down what this loop does and how it fits into the context of your object detection task:

Iteration Over Detections: detections.shape[2] gives the number of detections made by the SSD model in the current frame. The loop iterates over each detection to process them individually.
Detection Processing: Inside the loop, for each detection i, the code performs several tasks:
Extracting Detection Details: It extracts the class ID and confidence score of each detection. The class ID indicates the type of object detected (in your case, you're interested in the class ID for 'person' which is 15), and the confidence score represents the probability that the detected object is indeed a person.
Filtering by Confidence and Class ID: The code filters detections by checking if the confidence is greater than 0.88 and if the class ID corresponds to a person. This is to ensure that only high-confidence detections of persons are processed further.
Calculating Bounding Box Coordinates: For detections that pass the filter, the code calculates the bounding box coordinates. These coordinates are scaled to the actual size of the frame, allowing you to know where in the image the person is located.
Storing Detection Information: The code then assigns a unique ID to each detection (in this case, always 1 due to the condition if detection_id == 1:) and constructs a dictionary with the bounding box coordinates, confidence score, and a label. This dictionary represents the detected person.
Updating Current Frame Detections: The code checks if there's already a detection stored for the current detection ID. If there is, and the new detection has a higher confidence score, it updates the stored detection with the new one. Otherwise, it stores the new detection. This mechanism is designed to keep only the detection with the highest confidence score for a given detection ID, although the way the code is structured, it will only ever track one person due to the if detection_id == 1: condition.
Error Reporting: If a detection does not meet the confidence threshold or is not of the class ID for 'person', the code writes an error message to a report file. This is useful for understanding which detections were considered low-confidence or were not persons.
Final Actions: After iterating through all detections, the code writes the final state of the self.current_frame_detections dictionary to the report file. This dictionary contains the details of the detected persons in the frame that met the criteria for inclusion.
